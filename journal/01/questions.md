# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    >It allows us to upload code and save outside our local device. 
    >
    >We also use it to publish our code and keep our instructors up to date where we are and to work with others on the same code.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    >Is used to create a directory in command prompt.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Is a keyword added to a selector to specify a state of the element selected.
    >:hover, :checked, :required, :target, :active

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Determines which rule is more important than another of the same element.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Your code will most likely not be able to figure out which important is important.
    > It also overrides other declarations and can get confusing on what is supposed to happen.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, Property, Value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > If they see the screen and it looking bare and drab they will go somewhere else.
    >You can convey professionalism and care for the user by making it easy and well planned out.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Allows a dev to have a start on basic page structures and layouts.
    > Easy student training tools.
    > Client showcasing on the page will function and the purpose it serves.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I think having a few different wireframes would help. 
    > If you create a few different layouts you would have multiple uses of said code to refer to or use.
    > Which can shorten future coding projects.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex allows you to move content around the box or container in relation to multiple things.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Content, margin, padding, border
