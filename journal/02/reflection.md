# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Day 1
I DONT KNOW ANYTHING!

Day 2
I understand what needs to happen but I don't know how to make it happen without a lot of research.

Day 3
Some concepts are sticking in my brain. Still have to research.
Followed better. If I have the syntax in front of me I can read what it does. But I cannot repeat it from memory.
For loops are my friend!

Day 4
More stuff i don't know and have to remember.
