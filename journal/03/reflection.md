# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Day 1 
Ego was high after passing my Check point. Then got smashed with the new week course work.
I know nothing.
Day 2
Didn't understand the flow connections in mvc.
Day 3 
Little more sunk in to the brain.  Still getting the terms mixed up and where flow direction is supposed to be.
Need to watch videos.
Day 4
Not any easier. Still having hard time knowing what to use to make a thing happen...
