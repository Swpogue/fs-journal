# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Async works between servers.  synch is local and works at the same time.

02. What is an event listener?

  > listens for changes.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > Callback is a function that gets called back by something else once a async is complete. high order function returns a function instead of a simple value.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > It produces a value after an async operation completes successfully. Pop.error

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > GET, PUT, POST

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?
 
  > Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > Async the function.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Grouping of like concerns. Control flow. Security.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200 ok

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Bad request.
