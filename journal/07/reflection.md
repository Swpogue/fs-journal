# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Day 1
Aced check point. Starting new check point tomorrow.

Day 2
Refresh on node. Didn't get check point til 5 and then the info wasn't available.

Day 3
Got started on server side. Was moving very well but kept making typo errors that took to long to find.
Sever was finished at home.

Day 4
Stated on front-end. Still slow with this. Hopefully be done tonight!
