# Bootstrap
figma site
Think boxes
code containers, rows, columns
12 units in rows after that it will flex around
break points $grid-breakpoints: ();
title bootstrap clone
container fluid takes up the whole width
container class in header, main, footer
.row will add div and row
.col-6*2 will add syntax twice
.row syntax inside container class
debug on body get style from Sam push
use section for row instead of div
div class col-12 col-md-4 to shrink to smaller screen
class in img img-fluid to keep inside container and not spill out
form 3 input 1 text
type and id should match with label for
rows are auto d-flex
justify content center in parent to line 
use dummy text for placeholder
bs has multiple classes preloaded
mx class in bs is margin for x axis
my y axis
mt top
mb bottom
ms left
me right
nav position fixed= (sticky top) on header
img and text= inline text
careful when using margins in bs can break the grid system, p for padding works better.
class rounded in bs affects img
fw= font weight 
fs= font size 1 largest 16 smallest
=p-md-5 for smaller screens to ignore
btn btn-success
=mdi icons uses classes
i for icon mdi mdi-whatever
